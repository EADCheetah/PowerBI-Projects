This was an online/Linkedin challenge from FestManâ„¢ Learning Hub that I tried my hands on: FestMan Data Challenge - September 2021 Edition

Aim: "As the Lead Analyst, you've been tasked to analyze and visualize 10 years of Online Booking Orders to help Management review the current performance of the Business in order to make strategic decisions."
